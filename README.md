This is an artificial intelligence application developed based on the concept of **object detection**. Analyze basketball pitches by examining data collected in object detection.

First thing you need to do is install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Please note that you need a CPU to run the video analysis, CUDA device is required to run OpenPose.

Get a copy of this project by simply running the git clone command.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/blmendes/throw-the-ball.git
```


## Betting predictions
Tool that helps you when betting on NBA and NFL

## Shooting pose
Analyze basketball shots by digging into the data collected from object detection.
